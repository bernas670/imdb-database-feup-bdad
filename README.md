**Description:** For the database course we were challenged with creating a **database for a proposed context**. We decided on creating a database for a Movie/TV Show database similar do **IMDB**. The work was split into three checkpoints:

- **Checkpoint 1**: Conceptual model
- **Checkpoint 2**: Relacional schema, functional dependency analysis, db creation in SQL, constraint adding in SQL and populating database
- **Checkpoint 3**: SQL querries and triggers

Between checkpoints we were given feedback and we were allowed to improve for next checkpoints.
